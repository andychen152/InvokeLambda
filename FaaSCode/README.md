# FaaS Code

This codebase contains files that can be uploaded to AWS Lambda, Azure Function, and GCP Function. Azure Function and GCP Function will automatically provision a HTTP link to invoke the Function from. Lambda, however, will require you to set up a POST REST request through API Gateway.

## Setting up

Setting up is as simple as copy/pasting the code into the editors in each respective console.
