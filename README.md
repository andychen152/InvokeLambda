# InvokeLambda
Our goal is to invoke an AWS Lambda function from other cloud providers. Such functionality is essential in the real world with very little resources on how to set up the connections. We will test the connection across multiple clouds (ex. Azure and Google Cloud) and profile it, learning the pros and cons of each provider in this use case.
